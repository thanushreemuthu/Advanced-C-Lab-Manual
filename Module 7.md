## EXP NO:1 C Program FOR ARRAY OF STRUCTURE TO CHECK ELIGIBILITY FOR THE VACCINE.

### Aim:
To write a C Program for array of structure to check eligibility for the vaccine person age above 6 years of age.

### Algorithm:
1.	Declare structure eligible with age (integer) and n (character array)
2.	Declare variable e of type eligible
3.	Input age and name using scanf, store in e
4.	If e.age <= 6
-	Print "Vaccine Eligibility: No"

-	Print "Vaccine Eligibility: Yes"
5.	Print details (e.age, e.n)
6.	Return 0
 
### Program:

```
#include <stdio.h>
struct Person {
    int age;
    char name[50];
}per;

int main() {
    scanf("%d %s",&per.age,per.name);
    
    printf("Age:%d\n",per.age);
    printf("Name:%svaccine:%d\n",per.name,per.age);
    if (per.age <= 18) {
        printf("eligibility:no\n");
    } else {
        printf("eligibility:yes\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Ex No 5 : C  Program TO DISPLAY STUDENT DETAILS USING STRUCTURE

### Aim:
The Aim of this Program is to dynamically allocate memory to store information about multiple subjects (name and marks), input the details for each subject, and then display the stored information. Finally, it frees the allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

### Algorithm:
1.Input the number of subjects.

2.Read the integer value n from the user, which represents the number of subjects.

3.Dynamically allocate memory:

4.Use malloc to allocate memory for n subjects. Each subject has a name (array of characters) and marks (integer).

5.If memory allocation fails (i.e., the pointer s is NULL), display an error message and exit the ### Program.

6.Input the details of each subject

7.Use a for loop to read the name and marks of each subject using scanf. For each subject, store the name as a string and marks as an integer in the dynamically allocated memory.

8.Display the details of each subject

9.Use another for loop to print the name and marks of each subject.

10.Free the allocated memory

11.After all operations are done, call free(s) to release the dynamically allocated memory.

12.Return from the main function

13.End the ### Program by returning 0.

### Program:

```
#include <stdio.h>

#define TOTAL_WORKING_DAYS 84
#define MAX_DAYS_PER_MONTH 21

struct Student {
    int regNo;
    char name[50];
    int june;
    int july;
    int august;
    int september;
    int totalPresent;
    float attendancePercentage;
    char eligibility[4]; 
};

int main() {
    struct Student s;
    scanf("%d", &s.regNo);
    scanf("%s", s.name);
    scanf("%d", &s.june);
    scanf("%d", &s.july);
    scanf("%d", &s.august);
    scanf("%d", &s.september);
    
    if (s.june > MAX_DAYS_PER_MONTH || s.july > MAX_DAYS_PER_MONTH ||
        s.august > MAX_DAYS_PER_MONTH || s.september > MAX_DAYS_PER_MONTH) 
        {
        printf("Error: Days present in any month should not exceed 21.\n");
        return 1;
    }

    s.totalPresent = s.june + s.july + s.august + s.september;
    
    s.attendancePercentage = (s.totalPresent / (float)TOTAL_WORKING_DAYS) * 100;
    
    if (s.attendancePercentage > 75.0)
        sprintf(s.eligibility, "yes");
    else
        sprintf(s.eligibility, "no");
        
    printf("Reg.no:%d\n", s.regNo);
    printf("Name:%s\n", s.name);
    printf("Total.No.of.present days:%d\n", s.totalPresent);
    printf("Attendence:%.2f\n", s.attendancePercentage);
    printf("eligibility:%s\n", s.eligibility);

    return 0;
}
